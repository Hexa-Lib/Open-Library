# Open-Library
Open Library is a mini project created to make a platform for readers to read and/or download books and documents (pdf(s)).
The Library has a webpage hosted on Github Pages. The webpage is made to allow users to find and download/read books through one place rather than trying to find each book indivisually.

The Books added are either Copyright Free or have been Licenced from appropriate vendors/Publishers.
